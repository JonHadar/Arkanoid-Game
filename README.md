# Arkanoid-Game
The game is based on the classic Arkanoid game and was written in Java.
It starts with three balls, and the goal is to break all the blocks on the screen using the balls.
When a ball hits a block, the player earns 5 points, and the ball's color changes to match the color of the block it just destroyed.
If a ball falls below the platform, it disappears from the game, and the player is left with the remaining balls.
The objective is to break all the blocks with as many balls as possible.
If all three balls fall before completing the task, the game ends, and the game closes.
